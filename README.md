:::info Editor's note
This documentation is based on the [ToIP TT-Tools Proposal](toip-terminology-toolbox) memo, which we currently keep as a reference.
:::

The '[Terminology Engine v2 (TEv2)](tev2-overview)' consists of two parts:
1. The [Terminology Toolbox](tev2-toolbox) is a set of (extendable) command-line tools that can be used for generic purposes, such as resolving [term-references](term-ref@), and creating glossaries.
2. The use of these, and other tools (in our case: [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and [github CI/CD](https://resources.github.com/ci-cd/)), for facilitating the [curation](curate@) of [terminologies](terminology@) by [terms communities](terms-community@).

This repository is initially intended as a test bed for the CTWG Toolkit development and the develop branch
will contain the "latest" changes as they are merged and tested from feature branches.
